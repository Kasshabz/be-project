For safety reasons each person who clones this repo must create their own .env.* files

Step 1 - create a .env.test file and .env.development file
Step 2 - Into each, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names)
Step 3 - Make sure these files are in the git ignore
